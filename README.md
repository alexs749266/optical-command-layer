# Optical Command Layer (O.C.L.)

O.C.L. is a lightweight optical signaling protocol for device-to-device communication using visible binary pulses.

This method allows decentralized autonomous systems (including underwater, remote, or passive systems) to exchange command signals without relying on radio, WiFi, or cable.

## Features

- Uses off-the-shelf LEDs or laser pointers  
- Supports binary or multi-digit pulsed code  
- Requires only a camera or photodiode for decoding  
- Robust in environments with signal interference  
- Ideal for low-cost embedded systems, passive sensors, or drone communication

## Application Concepts

- Underwater passive communication between sensors  
- Optical control for isolated robots or smart infrastructure  
- Covert signaling systems for low-profile operations
